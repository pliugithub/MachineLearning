# Setting up the environment on a local machine

Many of the demos and labs in the class use the powerful
[Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/).  Jupyter notebook is a web-based application which lets you create
and edit documents with live python code and rich comments and images.  It is ideal for 
teaching.  You can install Jupyter notebook and other software
on any personal computer (Windows, Mac or Unix):
* Install [jupyter notebook and Python using Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).
  Make sure you install Python 3 for the demos in these tutorials.
* Follow the [github instructions](./github.md) to install
[github](https://guides.github.com/) and download the course material. (DON'T need if you use Google Colab)
* Later tutorials will require that you install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). (DON'T need if you use Google Colab)

# Google Colab does not always generate PDF correctly. 
It is recommended that you install Anaconda even if you use Colab to run your experiments. When you are ready to submit homework, restart the kernel and re-run your code on Colab. Then download the .ipynb file into your local computer. Open it with your local Anaconda Jupyter Notebook App and generate the .pdf file for submission.
